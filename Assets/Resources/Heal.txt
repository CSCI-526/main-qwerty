Let the light mend your wounds.
Breathe you’re safe now.
The pain fades, but your strength remains.
Healing is not weakness; it’s defiance.
Rise again, whole and unbroken.
May warmth flow through your veins once more.
Even shattered glass can reflect the sun.
The pulse returns, steady and strong.
Rest now; the battle can wait.
Life answers when called.
Hold still, I’m not a licensed healer!
Patch job incoming, warranty not included.
A little healin’ and dealin’!
Let me band-aid that attitude.
Because dying is so last season.
Now with 30% more sparkles!
Doctor’s orders: stop getting stabbed.
You break it, I remake it.
Feeling better? Good, my cooldown’s almost up.
Healing complete, side effects may include smugness.
