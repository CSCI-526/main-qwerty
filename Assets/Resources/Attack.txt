Strike true and end this swiftly.
Every blow carries my resolve.
No mercy for those who stand in my way.
The blade remembers.
One cut, one heartbeat.
Power flows through every strike.
The calm before the carnage.
Your guard falters now!
A strike as sharp as vengeance.
Even steel trembles before will.
Consider that a smack of approval!
Guess who’s axe-ing the questions now?
That hit? Pure impact performance!
You just got hammered!
Don’t worry, it’s only a flesh wound… mostly!
They never saw that punch line coming.
Boom! Straight to the highlight reel.
Crit happens.
Oops, my sword slipped into you.
That attack was super effective… emotionally!
